## Description

> The motivation for this project was to build a single-page application to meet PWA criteria.
> This project was built to implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database.
> This allows users to work offline with a Progressive Web Application using pre cached items.
> I learned how to use Service Workers and a Manifest.json file to increase my knowledge of offline apps.
